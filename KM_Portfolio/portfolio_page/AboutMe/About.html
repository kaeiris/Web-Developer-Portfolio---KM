        <h3>Why Hire Me</h3>
        <p> I'm passionate about anything that has to deal with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a big leap of faith to
            decide to learn to code. At first I was very intimidated and felt it was only for "smart" people.
        </p>

        <p>
            I placed my negative feelings aside and got to work. I have been
            coding for more than one year.  I've learned through the late nights and hours spent, that there's truth to the "cliche", "You can accomplish anything you put your mind to".
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, the process was difficult it did not hold me back to pursue my desire to become a Front End Web
            Developer. I share this to say I excel in what I love, which is helping people and coding.

            I'm Fast learner and dedicated to producing quality work. This won't feel like a job and this will be fun
            for me.
        </p>
